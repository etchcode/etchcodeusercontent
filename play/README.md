# play
This is the repository that will play etchcode projects. It is primarily Snap!, with some small modifications

It will run on it's own server so that if users get javascript into their project it can't access people's private data. As it will run in an iframe, it will not be able to access javascript of the page it is embedded in.

This should only play projects, with editing disabled.
